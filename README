# Project 3
My project 3 is about storying a mini market in the memory, along with a set that holds the most viewed
players on the market. I used zIncrBy, and zRange in order to create these sets, and get them in the order
I wanted them to be in.

I attempted to get the Node Express working but had some difficulties half way through the process
and while it was very fun and intreaging to learn about I desided to put my efforts towards studying to 
my finals instead.
